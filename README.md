Remind AI to clock out so that prevent exceeding time limitation. 

Functionality:

2. When in the library or some places quiet, you can turn sound off. So as the web's pop-out, if you want to use it as timer.

3. Since the IU system uses decimal to record how long you have clocked, the input field use decimal as well. For example, enter 1.5 hours means one and half hour. The transfer is done automatically.
